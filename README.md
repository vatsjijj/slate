# Slate
Slate is a very minimal build of Universal Blue meant to be a stepping stone to something like Arch or a branched Fedora release.

Slate is currently based on version 42 of the [Universal Blue base image](https://github.com/ublue-os/main).

# Notice
Slate is **alpha quality** software. Do not install this on production machines unless you're able to fix things by yourself or contribute to the project. Breaking changes will most definitely occur.

Slate is also currently an **NVIDIA** image, as I am new to this and am not sure how to publish a separate NVIDIA package.

# Installing
You can either rebase your current system image on Slate, or you can download the occasional ISO file from Actions.

To download the ISO from Actions, click on Actions and Click on the latest "Build disk images" action. There is a build artefact named `artefact.zip`, the ISO is in there.
