# Slate
Slate is a very minimal build of Universal Blue meant to be a stepping stone to something like Arch or a branched Fedora release. It is also meant for enterprises potentially.

Slate is currently based on version 42 of the [Universal Blue base image](https://github.com/ublue-os/main).

# Notice
Slate is **alpha quality** software. Do not install this on production machines unless you're able to fix things by yourself or contribute to the project. Breaking changes will most definitely occur.
